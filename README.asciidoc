== Use Forked repository !

This repository is obsolete right now.
Due that Fosenca has his repository in github i have forked it in:

https://github.com/fructu/xdot.py

== Multiline Feature

With this feature you can have nodes with more than 1 line of text and
when you click in one line you will obtain the associate text.

* This is a part of my project
https://github.com/fructu/abidos

* I used a modification of xdot.py

The originals are in:
http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/XDot
Copyright 2008 Jose Fonseca

version 0.5
modification to get multiline URL;
author: fructu@gmail.com

== example 1
Execute:
----
./example_01.py
----

You can see a node with 2 lines:
----
label="{hello\lworld}"
URL="hello|world",
----

Each with his correspondent message when you click the first line
you will obtain the first part of the URL:

image::images/hello.png[]

And when you click the second line you will obtain the second part of the URL:

image::images/world.png[]

The parts of the URL are separated by '|' you can change this separator easily
with:
----
xdot.options.set_multi_line_separator('|')
----
